Chapter 14: Shortest Paths through a Graph and the Traveling Salesperson Problem
========

###The Traveling Salesperson Problem

A classic example of a minimum problem is that of the [traveling salesperson problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) or TSP.  The problem goes like this: a salesperson needs to visit N cities on her route.  There is a known distance between all pairs of the cities.  What is the path she should take to minimize the total distance.  

Although such a problem may seem a bit archaic (at least the name is).  There are many problems that fit into this and in fact, when you use a mapping program to find the shortest route somewhere, at some level, there is a TSP in there somewhere.  

Here's how it goes.  The following in a complete graph in that 1) the graph is a set of nodes and edges that connect the nodes.  2) it is complete because any nodes is connected to all other nodes:

![K5 Complete Graph](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Complete_graph_K5.svg/200px-Complete_graph_K5.svg.png)

Let's say that the nodes are labelled from A (top) clockwise to E (upper left).  And then the distances between the nodes (also called the weights) are given by the following table:

|Node 1|Node 2|Distance|
|------|------|--------|
|A     |B     |26      |
|A     |C     |19      |
|A     |D     |39      |
|A     |E     |23      |
|B     |C     |13      |
|B     |D     |21      |
|B     |E     |42      |
|C     |D     |32      |
|C     |E     |25      |
|D     |E     |17      |

Again, the question is: What path through all of the nodes leads to the smallest total distance.  For example, if we choose A->B->C->D->E->A, the the total distance is 26+13+32+17+23=111

###Exhaustive Solution (or Brute Force)

In this case, there aren't that many total paths.  With 5 nodes, there are a total  24 different paths and that's not too difficult to traverse.  Let's look on how to do this in Julia.

First, let's put the distances into an array:
```
distances5=
[0 26 19 39 23;
26 0 13 21 42;
19 13 0 32 25;
39 21 32 0 17;
23 42 25 17 0]
```

where we've assumed that the distance of a node to itself is 0 and the matrix is symmetric because the distance from A to B is the same as from B to A.

Next, let's define a function that finds the total distance given a array of node numbers:

```
function function total_distance(nodes::Array{Int,1},distances::Array{Float64,2})
    ### given the path in the argument nodes, find the total distance travelled.

    local sum=0.0
    for i=1:length(nodes)-1
        sum+=distances[nodes[i],nodes[i+1]]
    end
    sum+distances[nodes[1],nodes[end]]
end
```

As a test if we pass the totalDistance the array [1 2 3 4 5], we should get the result 111.  

```
total_distance(collect(1:5),distances5)
```


####Permutations

This is a bit of a side conversation about permutations.  In short to permute objects means to exchange their positions.  Although permutations has a bigger scope and you can see [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) on Permutations for more information, we are going to concentrate here on permuting the entries in a vector.  Here are the following permutations of (1,2,3): (1,2,3),(1,3,2),(2,1,3),(2,3,1),(3,1,2),(3,2,1).  

There are 6 total here and in general, there are n! permutations of a vector of length n.  Julia has some nice built-in functions to create permutations.  For example to create the 6 permutations listed above, we first need to load the `Combinatorics` package:
```
using Combinatorics
```

```
for i=1:6
    println(nthperm(collect(1:3),i))
end
```

we use the `nthperm` command which needs a vector and an integer.  

A vector of anything can be permuted.  Here's an array of strings.

```
for i=1:24
    println(nthperm(["horse","zebra","camel","whale"],i))
end
```

which returns:

```
String["horse","zebra","camel","whale"]
String["horse","zebra","whale","camel"]
String["horse","camel","zebra","whale"]
String["horse","camel","whale","zebra"]
String["horse","whale","zebra","camel"]
String["horse","whale","camel","zebra"]
String["zebra","horse","camel","whale"]
String["zebra","horse","whale","camel"]
String["zebra","camel","horse","whale"]
String["zebra","camel","whale","horse"]
String["zebra","whale","horse","camel"]
String["zebra","whale","camel","horse"]
String["camel","horse","zebra","whale"]
String["camel","horse","whale","zebra"]
String["camel","zebra","horse","whale"]
String["camel","zebra","whale","horse"]
String["camel","whale","horse","zebra"]
String["camel","whale","zebra","horse"]
String["whale","horse","zebra","camel"]
String["whale","horse","camel","zebra"]
String["whale","zebra","horse","camel"]
String["whale","zebra","camel","horse"]
String["whale","camel","horse","zebra"]
String["whale","camel","zebra","horse"]
```

###Exploring all cases of the TSP

Returning to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), the example above has 5!=120 permutations or different paths.  An exhaustive search of the TSP is simply passing every permutation of the vector [1 2 3 4 5] to the `total_distance` function.  Then you search for the smallest total distance.  

If we first find all of the permutations:
```
perms=map(k->nthperm(collect(1:5),k),collect(1:factorial(5)))
```

then we can find the distance for each:

```
all_distances=map(p->total_distance(p,1.0*distances5),perms)
```

To find the smallest distance, we use:
```
findmin(d)
```

which returns (93,7) meaning that the value 93 is the smallest distance and it occurs in the 7th place.  To determine the path, apply the nthperm function again:
```
perms[7]
```

which results the path [1 3 2 4 5]  or A->C->B->D->E .

Note: there are other shortest paths, but this is just because you start in different places.  For example D->B->E->E->A is also one.


###We don't need to search everything

As we showed above, any solution will have each node in it.  We can then always take the first node (A or 1) to be in the first location.  This way we can just search the first 4! permutations (this will always have A first).

If we repeat our search in a more compact way using:
```
dist=map(k->total_distance(nthperm(collect(1:5),k),1.0*distances5),1:factorial(4))
```

and then find the smallest value:
```
findmin(dist)
```

we get the same result.  




###A larger example

Let's try a larger example.  This is for 10 cities, but can be extended easily.  First, let's just generate a matrix with some nice numbers that have the same properties as the distances from above.

```
distances10=rand(5:20,10,10)
```

will generate a 10 by 10 array of integers in the range 5:20.  To make this symmetric we can add the transpose of the array (the flip over the main diagonal).

```
distances10+=transpose(distances10)
```

and then zero out the main diagonal.
```
for i=1:10
  distances10[i,i]=0
end
```

and if you examine the distances10 array, you can see it has the properties we want.

Now, let's compute the total distance for all paths:
```
dist=map(k->total_distance(nthperm(collect(1:10),k),1.0*distances10),1:factorial(9))
```

and if you look for the smallest
```
findmin(dist)
```

My results are `(174,3149)`, which means that the smallest distance is 174 and occurs for the 3149th permutation.  You can find the permutation by typing

```
nthperm([1:10],3149)
```

which results in `[1 2 3 8 6 5 4 10 7 9]` which would be the path A->B->C->H->F->E->D->J->G->I .

Note: since the distances are generated randomly, you will get a different path and minimum distance.


###This isn't realistic for large n.

The examples we've done so far are for relatively small n.  If you try the method above for values much larger than 10, you'll notice it takes a long time to solve.  Also each increase to adding another node (or city) will increase the time by a increasing factor.  Note this is an example of a problem that is solved in factorial time (or exponential time)


###Simultated Annealing

A different way to think about this is to start with a path and then tweak it.  Before we get to the details, it is helpful to have the following function that performs a swap of two elements in the array.
```
function swapEls!(A,i,j)
    tmp=A[i];
    A[i]=A[j];
    A[j]=tmp;
end
```

Let's try looking at the N=5 case.

If we start with the case `path=collect(1:5)` then the total distance is
```
distance=totalDistance(path,distances5)
```

which is 111.

Next we will swap two elements at random by typing
```
swapEls!(path,rand(1:5),rand(1:5)); path
```

and then there will be a new path.  We'll check what the value of the distance is.  If it is smaller than distance (currently 111), then we'll store the path and the distance.



The resulting function that does all of this is:
```
function find_TSP(distances::Array{Float64,2},iter::Int)
    ###This will run simulated annealing on the TSP and return the shortest distance after iter iterations

    local N = size(distances,1)
    local path = collect(1:N)
    local min_dist = total_distance(path,distances)

    for i=1:iter
        swap_els!(path,rand(1:N),rand(1:N))
        dist=total_distance(path,distances)
        if dist<min_dist
            min_dist = dist
        end
    end
    (path,min_dist)
end
```

and then we can apply this to any distance array.  For example
```
findTSP(distances5,100)
```

results in
```
([1,4,2,5,3],93)
```

which says that the minimum path is from node 1 to 4 to 2 to 5 to 3 with total distance 93.


Similarly, with the distances10 array (which was created randomly)
```
findTSP(distances10,1000000)
```

results in
```
([8,2,10,6,4,9,5,7,3,1],169)
```

which is identical to what we found by going through all paths.

###A Larger Example

If we type
```
distances20=rand(5:20,20,20)
```

then
```
for i=1:20
    distances20[i,i]=0
end
```

then
```
distances20=distances20+transpose(distances20)
```

will generate a 20 by 20 distance array.  If we run:
```
findTSP(distances20,100000000)
```

generates (for me)
```
([17,20,11,13,16,3,18,15,6,10,9,1,7,2,4,19,14,8,5,12],331)
```

Note that since a distance array of this size is very large to find all paths, so we don't know if this is the minimum path.  Running it a few times will help convince you how close it is. For example, running it again results in
```
([19,1,6,9,16,7,3,13,8,17,15,5,14,12,4,11,18,2,10,20],362)
```

so obviously the path with distance 331 is better than this one.
