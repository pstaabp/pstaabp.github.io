Chapter 18: Images
=======

This chapter covers the details of a digital image.  In short, an image is a array that contains either gray scale or color information.

Gray Scale Images
-------

A gray scale image is just a visual representation of a 2D array.  To get started we need the following packages:

```
using Images, Colors, FixedPointNumbers, ImageView, TestImages
```

and you may need to add them.  In the `TestImages` package there are a number of images that we can load.  For example:
```
man = testimage("cameraman")
```

should produce an image of a cameraman.  If we type:
```
typeof(man)
```

then we get the following:
```
Images.Image{ColorTypes.Gray{FixedPointNumbers.UFixed{UInt8,8}},2,Array{ColorTypes.Gray{FixedPointNumbers.UFixed{UInt8,8}},2}}
```

which is a bit complicated, but in short, this is a 8-bit gray scale image, which means for each pixel, 8 bits are used to represent the scale of gray.  To see the data, typing
```
raw(man)
```

shows:
```
512×512 Array{UInt8,2}:
```

and then the data.  Notice that the size is 512x512, so it is a 512 by 512 image and the data type of the array is `UInt8` which is 8-bit unsigned integer.  

Also, notice that the first row, first column has value `0x9c` which is a way to represent a UInt8 where the last two digits are in hexadecimal.  

Loading in an image from a file
--------

We can also load an image from a file by using the `load` function.  For example, consider the following image:

![B/W photo](images/ch18/staab-bw.jpg)

 If you download it, then
 ```
 load("staab-bw.jpg")
 ```

 will load in the file and show it (if you are running jupyter).  You can then access the data as above.  

Creating a Gray Scale image
------

We can also create a gray scale image.   If we make an array of random `UInt8` values, such as
```
data=rand(UInt8,200,200)
```

and the data will look a lot like the data in the cameraman image above.  If we type:

```
grayim(data)
```

then you will get the image as well as a visualization of it. A less random image is:
```
data2=[(i-100)^2+(j-100)^2<50^2?UInt8(i+j-100):UInt8(125) for i=1:200, j=1:200]
```

and then `grayim(data2)` will give a dot with a gradient inside the dot.  

Color Images
======

We can load up a color image from the `TestImages` package such as
```
mandrill= testimage("mandril_color")
```

and notice in this case that `typeof(mandrill)` returns:
```
Images.Image{ColorTypes.RGB{FixedPointNumbers.UFixed{UInt8,8}},2,Array{ColorTypes.RGB{FixedPointNumbers.UFixed{UInt8,8}},2}}
```

which is a fairly complicated way to say that it is an 8-bit color (RGB) image. Entering `rman=raw(mandrill)` results in  the top being
```
3×512×512 Array{UInt8,3}:
```

which says that the underlying data is a 3 by 512 by 512 array.  The first component is the RGB value of each pixel.  For example:
```
rman[:,1,1]
```

returns
```
3-element Array{UInt8,1}:
 0xa6
 0x8b
 0x3e
```

and the first pixel is red: "A6", green: "8B" and blue: "3E" in hexadecimal.    

An interesting thing to do is to take one of the color channels and use this as the gray scale.  For example,
```
grayim(rman[3,:,:])
```

will make a gray scale image using the 3rd (blue) channel.

We can create a color image by assigning values to each channel of each pixel.  For example:
```
colorim(rand(UInt8,3,200,200))
```

creates a 200 by 200 image with random colors.  Assigning each pixel a particular color can be quite difficult.  Instead, there is a function called `ImageCmap` which produces an image using a color map (an array that maps numbers to colors). For example,
```
ImageCMap(data2,colormap("blues",255))
```

produces a color image which is a "blue" version of the gray scale above.
