Matlab and other CAS programs are powerful and helpful tools when performing mathematics involving sequences and series.  


Sequences
------

Recall that a sequence is a function that is defined on the nonnegative integers.  For example if
$$a_n = \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}$$

Then one can generate the first few terms of the sequence.  We can do this in Matlab by first defining $n$ and then applying the formula:
```
n=sym(1:10)
((-1).^n)./n
```
where we need to tell Matlab to do things element by element with a . in front of the power and division.  

shows the first 10 terms and returns:
$$-1,\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},-\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{6},-\frac{1}{7},\frac{1}{8},-\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{10}$$

We often are interested in finding the limit of this sequence, which is found by the command:
```
syms n
limit((-1)^n/n,n,inf)
```

and returns 0.  (Note: doing this by hand requires the squeeze theorem.)

### Sequences using a Recursive Definition

It is common to define sequences recursively.  We could say $a_0=1$ and then $a_n=\frac{1}{a_{n-1}+1}$.

Doing this by hand, would result in
$$a_0=1$$
$$a_1=\frac{1}{1+1}=\frac{1}{2}$$
$$a_2=\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$a_3=\frac{1}{1+\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{5}$$

What would the limit of this be?  

Before getting to this, we can use Matlab to generate these in the following way:
```
a = zeros(10,1,"sym");
a(1)=1;
for n=2:10
    a(n)=1/(a(n-1)+1);
end
a
```
* The first line generates a vector of zeros.  
* The second line starts the sequence as given
* The for loop generates the other terms based on the term before it. 

which generates:
$$1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{5},\frac{5}{8},{\frac {8}{13}},{\frac {13}{21}},{\frac {21}{34}},{\frac {34}{55}},{\frac {55}{89}},{\frac {89}{144}}$$

and the terms in the fraction may be recognizable as the Fibonacci numbers.   

However, since there is no formula for `a(n)`, we can't find the limit using the built-in function.  Here's a method instead: 

Assume that the sequence has a limit, that is
$$L=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a(n)$$

Then we take the limit of both sides of
$$a_n=\frac{1}{a_{n-1}+1}$$
to get:
$$L=\frac{1}{L+1}$$
and we can let Matlab solve this for us and it returns:
$$\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{5}-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{5}-\frac{1}{2}$$
and since the first term is positive and it is fairly clear that the limit should be positive, then
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$$
(BTW: this is a very famous number called the golden ratio.  The [golden ratio wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) is a good source.)


Introduction to Series
------

A series is a sum of all terms in an infinite sequence. For example,

$$1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+ \cdots$$

and is also written as
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^{n}}$$
We won't cover all of the details of series here, but will look at some of the capabilities that Matlab and other CAS software can lend to this.

First, let's look at a plot of this situation for a few values of $n$.
```
n=0:10
plot(cumsum(1./2.^n),'*-')
```
the `cumsum` makes the cumulative sum of the terms `1./2.^n` which is how $\dfrac{1}{2^n}$ needs to be written using vectors.  The result plot is

![Plot of the first few terms of the infinite sum](images/ch11/plot01.png)


Often, we'd love to be able to determine the value of a series.  For example, the series above is a geometric series with $a=1$ and $r=1/2$.  The sum is given by
$$S=\frac{a}{1-r}= \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2}} =2$$

Matlab is capable of finding the value of some series.  For example,
```
syms n
symsum(1/2^n,n,0,inf)
```

will return 2.  

#### Exercise

Use `symsum` to evaluate the following series:

1. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$
1. $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{2}}$
1. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{3/2}}$
1. $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}$

You'll notice that 3. returns a $\zeta$, which is the [Riemann Zeta Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function), a famous function that is defined as an infinite series.  

Determining Convergence of Series
------

Generally, it is very difficult to find the value of a series.  The ones listed above are special cases.  Generally, when trying to understand if a series converges or not, we need to use a convergence test.  We cover a few of those here.

Recall that if the value of the sum is finite, then we say that the series *converges*.  Otherwise, we say that the series *diverges*.



Integral Test
-----

Let $a$ be an integer and $f$ is a non-negative, decreasing function on $[a,\infty)$.  Then
$$\sum_{n=a}^{\infty} f(n)$$
converges if
$$\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx$$ converges.  Conversely, if the integral diverges, then the series diverges.  

###Example

Determine if
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3n+1}$$ converges or diverges.  

1. First, we note that $f(n)>0$ for on the interval.  We can let Matlab help us by doing
    ```
    syms x
    f(x) = 1/(3*x+1)
    S = solve(f(x)>0,'ReturnConditions',true)
    S.conditions
    ```

    and getting the result $(-\frac{1}{3},\infty)$, so this means that the function is also positive on a subset like $(1,\infty)$.  

2. Next, we need to determine that the function is decreasing on the interval.
    ```
    df(x) = diff(f(x),x)
    S = solve(df(x)<0,'ReturnConditions',true)
    S.conditions
    ```

    and this shows everything except $x=-1/3$, so again, it is decreasing on the interval $[1,\infty)$

3. Lastly, evaluate the integral:
    ```
    int(f(x),x,1,inf)
    ```
    results in $\infty$.  Since the integral diverges, by the integral test, the series diverges too.  


#### Exercise

Determine if $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{2}+1}$$ converges or diverges by the integral test.    Also, see if Matlab can evaluate it with the `symsum` function. 

Ratio Test (RATFACE)
-----

Another important test for convergence is the Ratio Test for Absolute Convergence (affectionately known as RATFACE).  

First, recall that a series of the form:
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$$
converge absolutely if
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n|$$
converges.  

The Ratio Test is:  Let
$$L=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|$$
The series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ converges if $L<1$, it diverges if $L>1$ and is inconclusive if $L=1$.  


### Example

Use RATFACE to determine if $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}$$ converges or diverges.  

Let's define
```
syms n
a(n) = 1/factorial(n)
```

And then taking the limit of the absolute value of the ratio, or 
```
limit(abs(a(n+1)/a(n)),n,inf)
```

returns 0.  Since this is less than 1, then series converges.  

#### Exercise

Use RATFACE to determine if
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{(n+3)^{n}}$$

converges or diverges.  Can Matlab find a value for this?  


Power and Taylor Series
-----

A power series is a series of the form:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n (x-a)^{n}$$
for known values $c_n$ and the number $a$ is called the *center*.  For example,
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}x^{n}$$
The first few terms of this power series:
$$1-x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}-\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{4}}{4!}-\frac{x^{5}}{5!}+\cdots$$
We can't plot a full power series because there are an infinite number of terms, but Matlab allows us to plot 10, 20 or 100 terms quite easily. These are called the *partial sums* or *partial series*.  

To plot up to $n=10$, we can define
```
f:=sum((-1)^n*x^n/n!,n=0..10)
```

and then plot $f$.  The result is

![The partial series up to $n=10$ of the series above](images/ch10/plot01.png)



### The Center of a series

If a series is written in the form:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n (x-a)^{n}$$

then the constant $a$ is said to be the center of the series.  For example, the series
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{3^{n}}{n}(x+2)^{n}$$
has a center of $a=-2$.  



### Interval and Radius of convergence

The *interval of convergence* is the set of all points on which a power series converges.  The center of the series will also be the center of the interval.  

The *radius of convergence* is half of the total length of the interval of convergence.  

###Example

Consider the series,
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n2^{n}}(x-3)^{n}$$

Find the center, interval of convergence and radius of convergence.

First, the center is $a=3$, because of the form of the series.  To find the interval of convergence, we will use RATFACE:
```
c:=n->(-1)^n*(x-3)^n/(n*2^n)
```

and if we
```
simplify(c(n+1)/c(n))
```

the result is
$$-\frac{1}{2}\frac{n(x-3)}{n+1}$$
The rule for RATFACE is that if
$$L=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left|\frac{c_{n+1}}{c_n}\right|$$
is less than 1, then the series converges absolutely.  Therefore taking the limit of the absolute value of the above expression yields
$$\frac{1}{2}|x-3|$$

To check if the endpoints are in the interval as well, we need to check the endpoints or where $x=1$ and $x=5$.  First, the left one. Substitute $x=1$ into $c_n$ or
```
simplify(subs(x=1,c(n)))
```

returns $\dfrac{(-1)^{2n}}{n}$ or $\dfrac{1}{n}$.  Recall that this means that when $x=1$, we have the series:
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$$
which diverges (it is the harmonic series).  

When $x=5$,
```
simplify(subs(x = 5, c(n)))
```

return $\dfrac{(-1)^{n}}{n}$ so this means when $x=5$, we have the series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}$$
and this series converges by the alternating series remainder theorem.  So the series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n2^{n}}(x-3)^{n}$$
converges on the interval $(1,5]$.  

The radius of convergence of this series is half of the total length or half of $5-1=4$.  Thus $R=2$.  

#### Exercise

Find the center, interval of convergence and radius of convergence of
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(x+2)^{n}}{5^{n}\sqrt{n}}$$


## Taylor Series

A function $f(x)$ has a power series defined at $a$. It can be represented by
$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^{n}$$

### Example

Find the first 5 terms (up to $n=4$)  of the Taylor Series of $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ using the center $a=1$.  

In Matlab, we can do higher level derivatives, with a strange notation.  The third derivative of $\sqrt{x}$ can be
```
diff(sqrt(x),x$3)
```

and this returns:
$$\frac{3}{8x^{5/2}}$$


So to do the first few terms of the Taylor series,
```
sum(subs(x=1, diff(f(x), x$n))*(x-1)^n/n!, n=0..4)
```

and this returns:
$$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{x}{2}-\frac{1}{8}\, \left( x-1 \right) ^{2}+\frac{1}{16}\, \left( x-1 \right) ^{3}-{
\frac {5\, \left( x-1 \right) ^{4}}{128}}
$$


However, Matlab also has this as a built-in command called `series`.  Typing
```
s:=series(f(x), x = 1, 5)
```

where $x=1$, means the center is at $a=1$ and we have 5 terms.  

The command returns
$$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{x}{2}-\frac{1}{8}\, \left( x-1 \right) ^{2}+\frac{1}{16}\, \left( x-1 \right) ^{3}-{
\frac {5\, \left( x-1 \right) ^{4}}{128}} + O((x-1)^{5})
$$

which is nearly identical to that above, except the final term, which means that the next larger power has the form $(x-1)^{5}$.  

###Plotting a Taylor Series

If you try to plot the series (result from the `series` command), you will get the following error:

`Warning, unable to evaluate the function to numeric values in the region; see the plotting command's help page to ensure the calling sequence is correct`

This is because of the last term.  You can remove it using
```
convert(s,polynom)
```

which converts this to a polynomial (or just removes the last term) and then plotting this and the original function is

![A plot of $\sqrt{x}$ and it's 4th order Taylor polynomial](images/ch10/plot02.png)


If we repeat the steps however use 50 terms, and replot, here are the results:

![A plot of $\sqrt{x}$ and it's 50th order Taylor polynomial](images/ch10/plot03.png)


You can see the interval of convergence from the plot in that the two functions are nearly identical on the interval $(0,2)$ and then the two functions are not equal beyond that.  In addition, the radius of convergence is 1.  

#### Exercise

Let $f(x)=\frac{1}{x+3}$.  Find $T_5(x),T_{10}(x),T_{100}(x)$ if $a=0$ and plot $f(x), T_5(x),T_{10}(x),T_{100}(x)$.
