title: 'Chapter 7: More Plots'

[Previous Chapter](ch-06.html) | [Return to all notes](index.html) | [Next chapter](ch-08.html)


We have already seen that Matlab has some great plotting capabilities.  In this chapter, we will see a number of other plots that Matlab (and most CAS programs) can produce. Note: we covered many of these in [Chapter 2](ch-02.html), but are repeated here so everything is in one chapter. 


### Plotting Functions

In order to plot the expression $x^{2}$, try typing `fplot(x^2)`. You should see a plot similar to

![Plot of $x^{2}$ using the default plotting range](images/ch02/plot01.png)

### Changing the Plotting Window of a plot

Typically, the easiest way to change the plotting window of the plot is to use an option in the plot command. For example, if we want a plot on the interval $[-2,2]$, then typing `fplot(x^2,[-2 2])` will produce the plot:

![Plot of $x^{2}$ on $[-2,2]$](images/ch02/plot02.png)

If you want to make sure that the axes include other y values, you can adjust the limits after the fact.  After you have the plot, try
```
fplot(x^2,[-2 2])
ylim([-2 2])
```
which will generate: 

![Plot of $x^{2}$ for $-2 \leq x \leq 2$ and $-2 \leq y \leq 2$ ](images/ch02/plot03.png)


If you’d like a title on your plot, you can add the title option. For example, try
```
fplot(x^2,[-2 2])
title("A plot of x^2")
```
and you will see

![Plot of $x^{2}$ with a title ](images/ch02/plot04.png)

Notice that matlab does some fancy formatting in that it formats `x^2` as a power.  You can put latex commands in the title (we will see what latex is later in the course.)

### Using Coordinate Axes

The standard way that Matlab plots functions is to use a box style with the tick marks on the bottom and left of the box.  If instead, you desire the standard coordinate axes, you can apply: 
```
set(gca, 'XAxisLocation', 'origin', 'YAxisLocation', 'origin')
```
after any plot. 
For example, the plot above with the plotting window adjusted as:
```
fplot(x^2,[-2 2])
ylim([-2 2])
title("A plot of x^2")
set(gca, 'XAxisLocation', 'origin', 'YAxisLocation', 'origin')
```
will produce:

![Plot of $x^2$ using coordinate axes](images/ch07/plot01.png)


### Changing the tick marks

A plot of $\cos x$ on $[-2\pi,2\pi]$, can be generated with:
```
fplot(cos(x),[-2*pi 2*pi])
```
and  looks like:
![Plot of $x^2$ using coordinate axes](images/ch07/plot02.png)

and I'm sure you noticed (since you are quite astute) that the tick marks are in integers and it would be nice to see the function plot in fractions of $\pi$ instead.  We can change this with the `xticks` and `xticklabels` functions.  Here is a cosine plot with some nicer ticks:
```
fplot(cos(x),[-2*pi 2*pi])
S =  sym(-2*pi:pi/2:2*pi);
xticks(double(S))
xticklabels(arrayfun(@texlabel,S,'UniformOutput',false))
```

and the result is:

![Plot of $\cos(x)$ on $[-2\pi,2\pi]$](images/ch02/plot05.png)

Before just plowing on, let's go through those last statements in detail.  The line:
```
S =  sym(-2*pi:pi/2:2*pi);
```
creates an array of symbolic values from $-2\pi$ to $2\pi$ by steps of $\pi/2$.  (Take the semicolon off the end of the line and rerun to see). The line
```
xticks(double(S))
```
sets the xticks to the numerical values (that's what the `double` function does) to the numbers in `S`.  Then 
```
xticklabels(arrayfun(@texlabel,S,'UniformOutput',false))
```
set's the tick labels on the x-axis to the values in `S`.  We'll see the `arrayfun` later and the `@texlabel` function is a way to ensure that the latex command is used to make things look better.  Again, we'll talk about latex later in the course. 

Make a mental note that this allows us to change the x-ticks to multiples of $\pi$ is a much nicer way.  You'll need this later.  

### Plotting multiple functions

Often, we would like to include more that one function on a single set of axes. Here is how to plot both $x^2$ and $x^3$. 
```
fplot([x^2, x^3],[-3,3])
```

The result is:

![Plots of multiple functions on the same axes  ](images/ch02/plot06.png)

### Adding a Legend

A legend is important for any plot containing more than one function. This allows you to distinguish between the curves. There is a legend option to the plot function. For example, to add a legend and a title to the plot of $x^{2}$ and $x^{3}$ type:

```
fplot([x^2 x^3], [-3,3])
title("A plot of x^2 and x^3")
legend("x^2","x^3")
```
and you will see:
![A plot of two functions with a legend](images/ch02/plot07.png)


## Changing the Aspect Ratio of a Plot

Recall that the function $f(x)=\sqrt{4-x^2}$ is the top half of a circle.  If we plot this with 
```
fplot(sqrt(4-x^2),[-2 2])
```
we'll get the following plot:
![A plot the top half of a circle](images/ch02/plot08.png)

and this just doesn't look like a circle.  This is because the aspect ratio isn't 1--this means that 1 unit in the x-direction and 1 unit in the y-direction are not equal.  

We can do that in Matlab with the following:

```
fplot(sqrt(4-x^2),[-2 2])
daspect([1 1 1])
```
and the result is:
![A plot the top half of a circle](images/ch02/plot09.png)

Note: there are three numbers here because we will see 3D plots need can have different aspects as well.  Matlab does this in general by ensuring that it know the relative sizes of all three axes. 
 

Piecewise Functions
--------

Another common plot is that of a piecewise function, consider
$$f(x) = \begin{cases} x & x<0 \\ 3-x^{2} & x \geq 0 \end{cases}$$

Recall that a piecewise function is a function $f$ takes on the values of $x$ when $x<0$ and when $x \geq 0$, then it has the functional form $3-x^2$.  We wil plot this by creating a plot with two different curves on it. 


The way to enter this in is the following:
```
f = piecewise(x<0,x,x>=0,3-x^2)
fplot(f, [-3 3])
```
and this results in the following plot:
![Plot of a piecewise function](images/ch02/plot11.png)


The vertical line connecting (0,0) with (0,3) is not part of the plot.  Matlab simply just connects a bunch of points.  Sometimes it seems that it can figure out that it's not part of the plot. Unfortunately, if it doesn't automatically remove the line, you need to do something different, like the following:

```
fplot(f,[0,3])
hold on
fplot(f,[-3,-0.0001])
hold off
```
which first plots the function on the interval $[0,3]$, then holds the plot which means that we can add additional graphs on the plot.  Then we plot the function on $[-3,-0.0001]$, which is just an approximation of 0--if you put in 0, you get the same results as above. Lastly, `hold off` switches the plot back to normal (meaning don't add additional graphs).  

The result is

![Improved plot of a piecewise function](images/ch02/plot12.png)

which is better but it looks like two different curves becaues the two pieces are different colors.  We can set them both to be the same color with:
```
fplot(f,[0,3],'blue')
hold on
fplot(f,[-3,-0.0001],'blue')
hold off
```
![Improved plot of a piecewise function](images/ch02/plot13.png)


#### Exercise 

Plot the piecewise function: 

$$
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
    1-(x-\pi/2)^2 & x > \frac{\pi}{2} \\
    1 & -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \\
    \sin x & x < -\frac{\pi}{2} \\
    \end{cases}
$$

Plotting Functions with discontinuities
------

Although Matlab doesn't often pick up on jump discontinuities from piecewise functions, it seems to do well with infinite discontinuities.  Consider:

```
fplot(1/(x-1),[-3,3])
```
which has the result: 

![plot of 1/(x-1)](images/ch02/plot14.png)

The vertical dashed line is a vertical asymptote in this case.  

#### Exercise

Plot $f(x) = \tan(x)$ on $[-3\pi,3\pi]$ and use multiples of $\pi/2$ for the horizontal labels.  Hint: see above to do this.  Does Matlab correctly pick up the vertical asymptotes in this case? 


Scatter Plots
----

A scatter plot is a set of points plotted in the $xy$-plane.  Consider the points $(0,1),(1,0),(2,1),(3,0)$.  We will see how to plot this. 

For this, we create a vectors of the x points and y points:
```
x=[0,1,2,3]
y=[1,0,1,0]
```
and the call the function `scatter`:

```
scatter(x,y)
```
resulting in

![Example of a scatter plot](images/ch02/plot15.png)

Notice that the points by default are open circles, which are hard to see. The next exercise goes through how to change the type and size. 

#### Exercise

1. Search for `scatter` in the help documentation.  There is a number of ways to change the size, shaped and color of the dots. 
2. Create a plot that looks like:

![line and point plot](images/ch02/plot16.png)

At the bottom of the `scatter` documentation has all of the options.

Combining Scatter and Function Plots
-----
We can combine a scatter and function plots  using the `hold` command. Let's say we have the points: (0,10),(2,9),(3,7),(5,6),(7,4),(8,2) and we wish to plot a best fit line as well.  First, let's define the points

```
x = [0,2,3,5,7,8];
y = [10,9,7,6,4,2];
```
The best-fit line can be found to be $y=10.8665-0.9680x$ and we will show how to do this later. 

```
scatter(x,y,100,'blue','filled');
hold on
fplot(@(x) 10.8665-0.9680*x,[-0.5,9])
hold off
```
Note: above, we have generally done `fplot(10.8665-0.9680*x,[0.5,9])` to plot the line.  However, becase we defined `x` to be an array of points, this won't work.  Try it!! The `@(x)` is way to redeclare `x` as a different variable.  We'll see this more later.  


This will produce a plot that looks like:

![Plot with functions and dots](images/ch02/plot17.png)



Implicit Plots
------

If a you have a function of $x$ and $y$ and would like to visualize the set of points that satisfy the curve, then `fimplicit` is what you want to use.  For example, the circle with center of the origin and radius 5 is 

```
syms x y
fimplicit(x^2+y^2==25)
daspect([1 1 1])
```

will give the following plot:

![Plot of a circle written implicitly](images/ch07/plot03.png)

where the aspect ratio has been set to 1 to make the circle like a circle.  Another example where this is needed is:

```
fimplicit(x^2/9+y^2/16==1)
```
generates
![Plot of $x^2/9+y^2/16==1$ ](images/ch07/plot04.png)
and is an ellipse, but just doesn't look right without changing the plotting window and the aspect ratio. 

The commands:
```
fimplicit(x^2/9+y^2/16==1)
xlim([-5 5])
ylim([-5 5])
daspect([1 1 1])
set(gca, 'XAxisLocation', 'origin', 'YAxisLocation', 'origin')
```
results in 
![Plot of $x^2/9+y^2/16==1$ ](images/ch07/plot05.png)


###Implicit curves don't always look right

The following equation
$$circles:=(x^{2}+y^{2}-1)(x^{2}+y^{2}-4)(x^{2}+y^{2}-9)(x^{2}+y^{2}-16) = 0$$
is a set of 4 concentric circles because the four terms that are multiplied are each a circle.  If any one of them is satisfied, then the equation is zero.  (Note: this is a supercool way of putting more than one equation on a plot.)

However, if we plot the equation, we get the plot:

![Plot of the equation above](images/ch06/plot05.png)

and you will see that there are jagged edges.  The reason that Maple produces the curve like this is that when making the plot, it uses a grid of points to try to determine if a point in on a curve.  By default, it uses relative few points for the grid and if this case, we will want more.

The `implicitplot` command has an option `gridrefine` that will help smooth out this curve.

We can plot the circles above by

```
implicitplot(circles,x=-5..5,y=-5..5,gridrefine=2)
```

You will get the plot:

![Plot of the concentric circles with gridrefine=2](images/ch06/plot06.png)


(Note: start with gridrefine=1 or 2 and if you need a smoother curve, increase this parameter slowly.  A gridrefine of 5 or more can take a long time.)


###Finding the derivative of an implicit curve

Recall that we can use the `implicitdiff` command to find the derivative of an implicit curve at a point.  For example, let's say that we wish to find the tangent line to the circle above at the point $(3,4)$.  

If we define the circle to be
```
circle:=x^2+y^2=25
```
then we can find the derivative by typing
```
implicitdiff(circle,y,x)
```
and Maple returns $$-\frac{x}{y}$$ and we can then use the `subs` command to evaluate this at a point.
```
subs([x=3,y=4],(#))
```
where (#) is the line number of the derivative.  The result should be $-3/4$ and then you can find the tangent line using the point slope form:
```
tanLine:=y=-3/4*(x-3)+4
```

where the tangent line is put in as an equation.  

###Implicit Plot of more than one equation

To plot these two on the same axes, use [] like in a standard function plot.  The plot of the circle and the tangent line can be found with

```
implicitplot([circle,tanLine],x=-1..2,y=-1..2,color=[red,blue],legend=["circle","tangent line"],title="A plot of a circle and its tangent line.")
```

![Plot of a circle and its tangent line](images/ch06/plot02.png)


###Exercise

1. Plot the cardiod given by $x^{2}+y^{2} = (2x^{2}+2y^{2}-x)^{2}$
2. Find the tangent line to the curve at $P(0,-1/2)$.  



Parametric Plots
------


A parametric graph or parametric curve is one in which the $x$ and $y$ coordinates depend on another variable, often $t$.  In general, we write
$$x=f(t) \qquad y=g(t)$$

A nice example is
$$x=t^{2} \qquad y=t^{3}-t$$

For a given set of values of $t$, the $x$ and $y$ values can be found by plugging into the functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$.  Using the command:
```
Matrix([[t, x(t), y(t)], seq([t, x(t), y(t)], t = -1.5 .. 1.5, .5)])
```

we get the following table:

$$\begin{array}{c|c|c}
t & x & y &  \newline \hline
-1.5 & 2.25 & -1.875 \newline
-1 & 1 & 0 \newline
-1/2 & 1/4 & -3/8 \newline
0 & 0 & 0 \newline
1/2 & 1/4 & 3/8 \newline
1 & 1 & 0 \newline
1.5 & 2.25 & 1.875
\end{array}$$

We can plot this in Maple using the standard `plot` command:
```
plot([t^2,t^3-t,t=-2..2])
```
where it is important to note the difference in syntax.  The range for $t$ needs to be there and *inside* the brackets.  The plot should look like:

![Plot of a parametric Curve](images/ch06/plot07.png)

#### Exercise

Replot the curves as above, except place the `t=-2..2` outside the brackets.  What is the difference?

###Another example

The parametric curve given by
$$x=\cos t \qquad y=\sin t$$
for $0\leq t \leq 2\pi$ is another way to write a circle with center at the origin and radius of 1.

This is because if we plug these functions into the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$, then
$$
(\cos t)^{2}+(\sin t)^{2}=1
$$
which is true for all $t$ because $\cos^{2} t + \sin^{2} t =1$.  

We can shift any curve horizontally and vertically in the following way, which we'll show using an example.  If we shift the circle above right 3 and up 2, we'll get the circle with center $(3,2)$.  This curve can be written:
$$x=3+\cos t \qquad y=2+\sin t$$
and plotting with a window that includes the origin is:
![Plot of a radius 1 circle with center (3,2)](images/ch06/plot08.png)

And we can make this an ellipse by multiplying the $\cos t$ and $\sin t$ terms by constants.  For example,

$$x=3+1.5\cos t \qquad y=2+0.8\sin t,$$ if we enter

```
plot([3+1.5cos(t),2+0.8 sin(t),t=0..2π],scaling=constrained,view=[-1..5,-1..5])
```

where the scaling is constrained so that the ellipse looks like an ellipse.  

![Plot of a an ellipse written parametrically](images/ch06/plot09.png)

###Let's make a line segment

Any curve written in terms of $y(x)$ can be written parametrically in the following way.  Let $x=t$, then let $y=y(t)$.  For example, consider the line $y=2x+1$.  This can be written:
$$x=t\qquad y=2t+1$$
If we want to plot it from $x=-1$ to $x=1$, then $t$ will satisfy: $-1 \leq t \leq 1$  and the following command:
```
plot([t,2t+1,t=-1..1])
```
will generate the following plot:
![Plot of a line segment](images/ch06/plot10.png)

###Parametric piecewise functions

Mixing parametric functions and piecewise functions gives tons of flexibility.  Let's plot both a circle and a line segment using the same function.  First, let's find the line segment connecting the points $(0,3)$ and $(1,0)$. The slope of this is $-3$, so the function is $y=-3(x-0)+3$.  Parametrically, we can write this
$$x=t \qquad y=-3t+3$$

We will notice later that it will be helpful to use $t$ values bigger than $2\pi$, so an alternative is to use
$$x=t-10 \qquad y=-3(t-10)+3$$

If we also want a circle of radius 2, centered at (4,2), we can write that as
$$x=4+2\cos t \qquad y=2+2\sin t$$

Then we produce the following piecewise function by defining:
```
x:=piecewise(0<=t<=2*pi,4+2*cos(t),10<=t<=11,t-10)
y:=piecewise(0<=t<=2*pi,2+2*sin(t),10<=t<=11,-3*(t-10)+3)
```
then if we plot this piecewise:
```
plot([x,y,t=0..11],discont=true,view=[0..6,0..6])
```
will give the plot:
![Plot of a piecewise parametric](images/ch06/plot11.png)

and make sure that you put `discont=true` option so the line segment is not connected to the circle.  



###Tangent line to a parametric curve

Here we reproduce the tangent line to the circle of radius 5 at the point $(3,4)$.  


The parametric curve given by
$$x=5\cos t \qquad y=5\sin t$$
for $0\leq t \leq 2\pi$ is another way to write a circle with center at the origin and radius of 5.

To plot this in Maple, we use the `plot` command with a different syntax.
```
plot([5*cos(t),5*sin(t),t=0..2pi])
```
will produce the following circle.

![Plot of a circle written parametrically](images/ch06/plot01.png)

which is the same plot as the implicit one above.  



To make some things easier, let&#8217;s define
```
x:=t->5*cos(t)
y:=t->5*sin(t)
```

We can also find the tangent line to a parametric curve in the following way.  The derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to a curve can be written:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
$$

To find the derivative to the circle above at the point $(3,4)$, we need to find the $t$ value at the point.  We can do this by solving for $t$ by setting $x=3$ and $t=4$.  (It's recommended to use the `Roots` command on the interval `0..`$\pi/2$ because the point is in the first quadrant.)

```
Roots(x(t)=3, t = 0 .. (1/2)*Pi)
```
returns  $[\arccos(3/5)]$
and
```
Roots(y(t)=4, t = 0 .. (1/2)*Pi)
```
returns  $[\arcsin(4/5)]$.  They seem to given different answer, but they are equivalent.

If we substitute either of these into the derivative above:
```
subs(t=arccos(3/5),y'(t)/x'(t))
```
and then simplify it.  The result is $-3/4$, the same answer as above using implicit differentiation.  


The tangent line then is the curve
```
tanLine:=-3/4(x-3)+4
```

again, the same as above and can be written parametrically as
$$
x=t \qquad y=-\frac{3}{4}(x-3)+4$$

and the following will put the circle and the line on the same axes:
```
plot([[t, -3/4*(t-3)+4, t=-2..8], [5*cos(t), 5*sin(t), t=0..2*Pi]], view = [-5..8,-5..8])
```

with give the following plot (which is identical to others above):

![plot of a circle with its tangent line](images/ch06/plot15.png)


Polar Plots
------

It is often that one will use polar coordinates to create a plot.  Here are a few examples where this is helpful.  If a function is written in polar coordinates, then it is written in the form $r=f(\theta)$.

This is a specific form of a parametric curve with the form:
$$x=r \cos \theta \qquad y=r\sin \theta$$

For example, the cardioid that you plotted above can be written:
$$r=1+\cos(\theta)$$
and we can plot it using the `polarplot` command
```
polarplot(1+cos(theta), theta = 0 .. 2*Pi)
```
(and note that you can get theta to look like the greek letter, by hitting ESC after typing `theta`)

The plot will look like:
![A cardioid plotting in polar coords](images/ch06/plot12.png)

And alternatively, if you don't want the polar axes shown, you can use the regular plot command with the `coord=polar` option:
```
plot(1+cos(theta),theta=0..2*Pi,coords=polar)
```
which will generate the plot:
![A cardioid plotting in polar coords](images/ch06/plot13.png)

###A tangent line to a polar plot.  

The curve $r=1+2\sin \theta$ passes through the origin.  We will find the tangent line to the curve at the point.


First, a plot of the curve is

![Plot of the curve $r=1+2\sin \theta$](images/ch06/plot14.png)


We now seek the tangent line to the curve at the point $P(1,0)$.  It's helpful to define the $x$ and $y$ coordinates parametrically using $x=r \cos \theta$ and $y=r \sin \theta$ for $r=1+2\sin \theta$:
```
x(theta) := (1+2*sin(theta))*cos(theta)
y(theta) := (1+2*sin(theta))*sin(theta)
```

And then to find the value of $\theta$ at the point $P(1,0)$, we set $x=1$ and $y=0$.
```
Roots(x(theta)=1,theta=0..Pi/2)
```
(where we use 0..Pi/2 because the point $P(1,0)$ is in the first quadrant), results in
$$[0,\arctan \left( 1/3\,{\frac { \left( 28+3\,\sqrt {87} \right) ^{2/3}
+4\,\sqrt [3]{28+3\,\sqrt {87}}+1}{\sqrt [3]{28+3\,\sqrt {87}}}}
 \right) ]
$$
(and recall these are values for $\theta$.)  The first one is what we want because $\theta=0$ is the horizontal axis.  Note: if you are interested in the other point where $x=1$, then substitue the other value into $x$ and $y$ above as `x((#)[2])` and `y((#)[2])`, for (#) the line number of the expression.  You may need to use simplify or `evalf` to get an approximate value.  The result is approximately $(1,2.6956)$.

Also, to double check, solve for $y=0$ using
```
Roots(y(theta)=0,theta=0..Pi/2)
```

then we get  `[0]`,  which is consistent with above.  The slope of the tangent line at the point $(1,0)$, where $\theta=0$ is
```
y'(0)/x'(0)
```

which is $\frac{1}{2}$.  Then using the point-slope formula for the tangent line, we get:
$$y=\frac{1}{2}(x-1)+0$$

To plot both, we'll use the parametric form (an alternative way will be presented below):
```
plot([[x(theta),y(theta),theta=0..2*Pi],[t,1/2*(t-1)+0,t=-1..2]])
```

to get the plot:
![A plot of a polar curve and its tangent line](images/ch06/plot16.png)

###Exercise
Find the tangent line to the cardioid $r=1+\cos(\theta)$ at the point $(0,1)$.  Plot both on the same axes.  


Multiple plot types and the `display` command
------

We have seen above that if we want to plot more that one curve on the same axes.

If we want to plot the parametric curve
$$x=2\sin 2t \quad y=2\sin t,$$
with the implicit curve given by
$$(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}-2(x^{2}-y^{2}) = 1$$

then so far we would have to turn the parametric curve into an implicit one or the implicit one into a parametric curve.  Neither may be easy or possible.  Instead, here we will plot both and then put them together with the `display` command.  

###Plot of the first curve

Since the first curve is parametric, let's plot it like:
```
plot1:=plot([2*sin(2*t), 2*sin(t),t=0..2*Pi])
```
where we have given the plot a variable name.  The plot is

![Plot of a parametric curve](images/ch06/plot17.png)

###Plot of the 2nd curve

And the second curve is implicit so
```
plot2:=implicitplot((x^2+y^2)^2-2(x^2-y^2)=1,x=-2..2,y=-2..2)
```

![Plot of an implicit curve](images/ch06/plot18.png)

and as you can see, we'll adjust it with the `gridrefine` option by setting it to 1.  

To put these together, we'll use the `display` command and adjust some colors and add a legend for each.  

```
plot1 := plot([2*sin(2*t), 2*sin(t), t = 0 .. 2*Pi], legend = ["parametric curve"]):
plot2 := implicitplot((x^2+y^2)^2-2*(x^2-y^2) = 1, x = -2 .. 2, y = -2 .. 2, color = blue, legend = "implicit curve", gridrefine = 1):
display(plot1, plot2);
```
Notice that the two plot commands have a colon at the end now so the plots aren't actually shown.  Only the plot via the `display` command is shown.  The plot is

Common Options
------

Recall that the following options are available for all plots.  

* `view` which changes the viewing window.  Note: you should change the plotting domain as well with this.   
* `legend` which adds a legend.
* `color` which changes the color.

Additionally, look at the help page for plot to determine other helpful options.  



Scatter Plots
------

A scatter plot or a point plot is a plot of set of points given as $(x,y)$ coordinates.  We saw this in Chapter 2, but expand a bit more here.


Plot a set of discrete points as follows:

1. Enter the expression:`dots:=[[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[3,0]]`
2. Enter the expression: `plot(dots,style=point)`

and you should see the following plot:

![plot of a few points](images/ch02/plot11.png)

The points will be plotted as what is called a scatter plot. In order to connect the dots, add the style=line option to the end of the command.

We can also use the `pointplot` command in the plots package.
```
pointplot(dots)
```
which generates the same picture as above.   Let's generate the following plot using the `symbol` and `symbolsize` options.  


![line and point plot](images/ch02/plot12.png)

First, let's define the points as
```
pts:=[[1,1],[2,1],[1,2]]
```
and we can plot these with large filled in circles with
```
plot(pts, style = point, view = [0 .. 2, 0 .. 2], symbol = solidcircle, symbolsize = 15)
```
and similarly, we can create a line plot with the same points except that we need to repeat the first one to get a complete triangle
```
pts1 := [[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 2]];
pts2 := [[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1]];
plot([pts1, pts2], style = [point, line], color = ["DarkRed", "DarkRed"], view = [0 .. 2, 0 .. 2], symbol = solidcircle, symbolsize = 15)
```
will reproduce the picture above.  You can also produce two separate plots and put them together.  

```
plot1 := pointplot(pts, symbol = solidcircle, symbolsize = 15):
plot2 := plot(pts2):
display(plot1, plot2, view = [0 .. 2, 0 .. 2])
```

will also produce the picture.  Note:  for this plot the `view` option needs to be on the display command not the plot command.  


animated plots
------

Animated plot are often helpful to visualize if you have a parameter in a plot and you want to view what's happening to it.  Consider the following: How does the parameter $a$ affect the graph of $y=(x-a)^{2}$.  Examine $a$ from $-3$ to $3$.

Note: a standard plot cannot handle with because there is both a variable $x$ and one called $a$.  If you just try to plot $(x-a)^{2}$, you will get an error.  However, an animated one will help with this.

If we enter:
```
animate(plot, [(x-a)^2, x = -5 .. 5], a = -3 .. 3)
```
and then hit the play button on the toolbar, you will see the parameter $a$ change as listed in the title of the plot. In general, there are three parts of the animate command (check out the Help Browser):

* the first parameter is the plotting command (this is just `plot`, but you can do other plots)
* the second parameter is a list that is passed to the command in the 1st parameter.  In this case this would be
    ```
    plot((x-a)^2,x=-5..5)
    ```

    and this is where any other options should be put as well.  (Look below for examples)
* The third parameter is the range on the animation parameter.  For what values is the animation made.  


It's a bit hard to see what happens though because of the plotting window, so let's add a view option to the animation:

```
animate(plot,[(x-a)^2,x=-5..5,view=[-5..5,-1..10]],a=-3..3)
```
and if you run this you can see that as $a$ increases the vertex shifts to the right.  

The following animation is the result:

![plot of $(x-a)^{2}$](images/ch06/animation01.gif)


###A Parametric Example

Perhaps we want to see what happens to the parametric curve
$$
x=5\cos(t)\qquad y=b\sin t$$
for some $b$ values. We also use the animate with plot, but the 2nd parameter needs to be written in a different way:
```
animate(plot, [[5*cos(t), b*sin(t), t = 0 .. 2*Pi]], b = 1 .. 8)
```
where the 2nd parameter needs to be in 2 sets of square brackets because for a parametric plot the functions needs to be a list.

The animation, which is below, shows that the parameter $b$ is the height of the ellipse and you should set the plotting to be 1:1 for an accurate view of this.  

![plot of the parametric curve $x(t) = 5 \cos t$, $y(t)=b\sin(t)$](images/ch06/animation02.gif)


###An polar plot example

We can also make a animation based on a polar plot.  Take for example,
```
animate(polarplot, [1-a*sin(theta), theta = 0 .. 2*Pi], a = -4 .. 4)
```

![plot of the polar curve$ r=1-a\sin(\theta)$](images/ch06/animation03.gif)


###Exercise

The set of points defined by
$$y^{2} (y^{2}-a^{2})=x^{2}(x^{2}-b^{2})$$
are called the Devil's curve.  Let $b=1$, and let $a$ range from 0.1 to 2.1 in an animated plot.





Three Dimensional Plots
------

Maple also handles some plots in three dimensions.  This is just a few examples.  Take a look at the Help Browser for more information on these.

Notice after plotting each of these, you can use your mouse to spin the plot around getting a better perspective.  

###Three-D Function plot

This is plot of the function $z=x^{2}+y^{2}$.

```
plot3d(x^2+y^2, x = -2 .. 2, y = -2 .. 2)
```

![3D plot of $z=x^{2}+y^{2}$](images/ch06/plot20.png)

###Three-D parametric plot

This is a plot of a helix written parametrically:
$$x=\cos t \qquad y=\sin t \qquad z=t/10$$

```
spacecurve([cos(t), sin(t), t/10], t = 0 .. 4*Pi)
```

which results in

![plot of the helix](images/ch06/plot21.png)

###Implicit plot in 3 variables

Here's a plot of the sphere
$$x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$$

```
implicitplot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1, x = -1 .. 1, y = -1 .. 1, z = -1 .. 1)
```

which produces the plot:
![plot of a sphere](images/ch06/plot22.png)


### Vector Field plots


A basic plot of the field $\textbf{F} = y \hat{i}-x \hat{j}$ is
```
fieldplot([y,-x], x=-10..10,y=-10..10)
```

gives the plot:

![Plot of a vector field](images/ch06/plot23.png)

and if you want a direction field (in that the length of the vectors are all the same)
```
fieldplot([y,-x],x=-10..10,y=-10..10,fieldstrength=fixed)
```

and the result is
![Plot of a vector field](images/ch06/plot24.png)

If we want a 3D plot of a vector field, say
$$\vec{F}(x,y,z) = x \hat{i}+y \hat{j} + z \hat{k}$$

```
fieldplot3d([x, y, z], x = 0 .. 2, y = 0 .. 2, z = 0 .. 2)
```

produces
