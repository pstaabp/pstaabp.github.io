[Return to all notes](index.html)

This chapter covers how to perform many mathematics that arises from Calculus using a CAS like Matlab.  As we will see, a CAS will often do limits and derivatives quite easily, allowing us to investigate the geometry of the derivative using a plot or a table of values, which are often helpful for gaining intuition about limits and derivatives.

Limits
-----

You may need to review the basics of a limit from Calculus.  If we say
$$L = \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} x^{2}$$
then $L$ is the value of the function $x^{2}$ as $x$ approaches 1 (from either side), but not at exactly 1.  We can examine this using a plot of the function:

![Plot of $x^{2}$](images/ch05/plot01.png)

And from the plot it appears that the limit is 1, however, you can never say precisely with a plot, but this can help verify a result.  

Another way to attack this is with a table.  Let's find the value of the function $f(x)=x^{2}$, at the points $x=0.9,0.99,0.999,1.001,1.01,1.1$.  We can do this easily with the `arrayfun` function.  If

```
syms x
f(x) = x^2
xvals=[0.9,0.99,0.999,1.001,1.01,1.1]
yvals=double(arrayfun(@(x) f(x),xvals))
```
will produce the function values of all of the $x$ values given or
```
[.81, .9801, .998001, 1.002001, 1.0201, 1.21]
```

Note: to find `yvals` must have a `double` as the outer function to switch back to floating point numbers.  

We can make the this look a bit more like a table with
```
transpose([xvals;yvals])
```
it will look like: $$ \begin {array}{ll}  
0.9& 0.81\\
0.99&0.9801\\
0.999& 0.998001\\
 1.001& 1.002001\\
 1.01& 1.0201\\
 1.1& 1.21\end{array}
$$

As you can now see from the table above, as $x$ gets closer to 1, $x^{2}$ gets closer to 1.  You're thinking, duh, $1^{2}=1$, which is true, but we often use a limit when you can't just evaluate a function at the point $a$.  

### Exercise

Reproduce the table above using $$f(x)= \frac{x^{2}-4}{x-2}$$
when $a=2$.  Use an appropriate set of points that are both less than and greater than 2.  Guess a value of the limit.  


### Using Matlab's built-in Limit function.


Now, of course, Matlab (and any CAS) will do the limit for us.   If we enter
```
limit(f(x),x,1)
```
then Matlab returns 1. 

###Exercise
Try evaluating the following limits:

1. $$ \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{x^{2}-4}{x-2}$$

2. $$\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin t}{t}$$

3. $$\lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{\ln x}{x-1}$$


One-Sided Limits
----

Recall that a one-sided limit is a limit as $x \rightarrow a$, where only values either less than or greater than $a$.  As an example, let
$$
g(x) = \begin{cases}
1+x & x < 0 \\
x^2 & x \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

and we can plot this (nicely) with

```
fplot(x+1,[-3,0],'blue')
hold on
fplot(x^2,[0,3],'blue')
hold off
set(gca, 'XAxisLocation', 'origin', 'YAxisLocation', 'origin')
```

which results in:
![A plot of the piecewise function $g(x)$](images/ch05/plot01a.png)

Looking at the plot, the left- and right-handed limits appear to be:
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-} g(x) = 1 \qquad
\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} g(x) = 0
$$

and we can use Matlab to do this with
```
limit(g(x),x,0,'left')
limit(g(x),x,0,'right')
```
returns 1 and 0 respectively. 


#### Exercise 

Let 
$$
h(x) = \begin{cases}
2x+3 & x < -2 \\
x^3 & -2 \leq x < 1 \\
\sin (\pi x) & x \geq 1
\end{cases}
$$

Find the following one-sided limits:

* $$\lim_{x \rightarrow -2^-} h(x) $$
* $$\lim_{x \rightarrow -2^+} h(x) $$
* $$\lim_{x \rightarrow 1^-} h(x) $$
* $$\lim_{x \rightarrow 1^+} h(x) $$

Secant and Tangent Lines
------

Recall that a secant line through a function is the line that passes through the function at two points.  For example, consider the secant line through the function $f(x)=x^{2}$ that passes through the function when $x=1$ and $x=2$.  A plot of this is:

![A plot of $x^{2}$ and it secant line](images/ch05/plot02.png)

and you can see from the plot that indeed the line passes through the given points.  Also, recall to find the slope of the secant line, we'll need to evaluate the function at the $x$ values.  
```
f(x)=x^2
m = (f(2)-f(1))/(2-1)
```
which is 3 in this case.  We can then use the point-slope form of the line with either the point $(1,1)$ or $(2,4)$.  

The reason that we discuss secant lines in Calculus, is that we want to know the tangent line, which is the line that just touches at a single point.  We can't find a line given only one point, but if we find a number of secant lines that pass through (1,1), we hopefully can find a trend that leads to the tangent line.  Then we will use calculus to do this precisely.  

If instead of defining the slope of the line through $(1,1)$ and $(2,4)$, instead, let's make a function that is the slope of the line that passes through $(1,1)$ and $(t,t^{2})$.

```
syms t slope(t)
slope(t)=(subs(f,x,t)-subs(f,x,1))/(t-1)
```

Now this will allow us to find the slope of the secant line for any point $x$.  We can also build a table like above.  
```
xvals = [1.5,1.9, 1.99, 1.999, 2.001, 2.01, 2.1,2.5]
slope_vals = arrayfun(@(t) double(slope(t)),xvals)
transpose([xvals;slope_vals])
```

And you will see $$\begin {array}{ll}  
0.5 & 1.500000000 \\
0.9& 1.900000000\\
0.99 & 1.990000000\\
0.999& 1.999000000\\
1.001& 2.001000000\\
1.01& 2.010000000\\
1.1& 2.100000000\\
1.5& 2.500000000
\end {array}$$

We can use this to estimate the tangent line of $m=2$ which we will verify below.




### The tangent line

Recall that the slope of the tangent line to a curve $f(x)$ at $x=c$ is given by
\[
    m = \lim_{x \rightarrow c} \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}
\]

For the function $f(x) = x^2$, the slope is 
$$m = \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}$$
which can be done in Matlab with:
```
limit(@(x) (x^2-1)/(x-1),x,1)
```
and return 2. Therefore the tangent line is
```
tanLine:=2*(x-1)+1
```
and a plot of the function with its tangent line at $x=1$ is given as

![Plot of $x^{2}$ and its tangent line](images/ch05/plot04.png)

#### Exercise

Use the definition of the tangent line like above to find the tangent line to the curve 
$$ y= \frac{1}{x+1}$$ at $x=1$. Plot the function and the tangent line on the same axes.  

Asymptotes
------

In precalculus you were introduced to asymptotes of functions.  In generally, an asympote of a function is a line that the function approaches far from the origin.  In calculus, there is a more specific definition.  

### Horizontal Asymptotes

The line $y=L$ is a **horizontal asymptote** of a function $f(x)$ if
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = L
$$

or

$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} f(x) = L
$$
and visually, you can see a horizontal asymptote by looking at a function and determining it is approaching a horizontal line as $x \rightarrow \infty$ or $x \rightarrow -\infty$.  

For example, consider the function
$$
f(x) = \frac{2x-1}{x-3}$$

which we will 

A plot of this is

![Plot of $\frac{2x-1}{x-3}$](images/ch05/plot05.png)

and (it's bit hard to see), but there is a horizontal asymptote which is about $y=2$.  (Recall that an asymptote is a line, so you should write it as such)

Since this is hard to see, we can use the definition above to find the limit.  Doing
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2x-1}{x-3}
$$

and

$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} \frac{2x-1}{x-3}
$$

returns 2 in both cases.  Therefore $y=2$ is the only horizontal asymptote.  

### Vertical Asymptotes

The definition of a vertical asymptote is a bit more complicated.  The line $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote of the function $f(x)$ if at least one of the following is true

* $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=\infty$
* $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^{+}} f(x) = \infty $
* $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^{-}} f(x) = \infty $
* $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=-\infty$
* $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^{+}} f(x) = -\infty $
* $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^{-}} f(x) = -\infty $

In other words, the limit (one-sided or both-sided) is infinite.

For the function seen above, the line $x=3$ is a vertical asympote because it appepars from the plot that
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 3^{+}} \frac{2x-1}{x-3}=\infty$$

but we can use limits to do this with:
```
f(x) = (2*x-1)./(x-3)
limit(@(x) f(x),x,3,'left')
limit(@(x) f(x),x,3,'right')
```
which returns $-\infty$ and $\infty$ respectively.  

Now this provides a way to prove that a vertical line is a vertical asymptote, but not how to find them.  If you have a rational function (polynomial over a polynomial), then possible vertical asympotes are where the denominator is 0.    For example, let's look at the function
$$R(x)=\frac{x^{2}-1}{x^{3}-13x+12}$$


We can find the possible vertical asymptotes by finding the zeros of the denominator or
```
R(x)=(x^2-1)/(x^3-13*x+12)
solve(x^3-13*x+12==0)
```
which returns 1,3,-4.



If you check if each zero above is a vertical asymptotes, you will notice that the limit at $x=1$ is $-\frac{1}{5}$, and not infinite.  The left- and right-handed limits at $x=3$ and $x=-4$ are infinite, so those are vertical asympotes.  This is also consistent with the plot of the function:

![Plot of the function $R(x)$](images/ch05/plot06.png)

### Plots of functions with their asymptotes


 Consider the function $$R(x) = \frac{4x^{2}-20x+16}{x^{2}+2x-15}$$
which can be plotted with:
```
Q(x) = (4*x^2-20*x+16)/(x^2+2*x-15)
fplot(Q(x),[-15,15])
set(gca, 'XAxisLocation', 'origin', 'YAxisLocation', 'origin')
```
and the result is:
![Plot of the function $R(x)$](images/ch05/plot07.png)


One can see the two vertical asymptotes, $x=-5$ and $x=3$ however, you can't see the horizontal asymptote.  Recall that if we do:
```
limit(Q(x),x,inf)
limit(Q(x),x,-inf)
```
these both return 4, so the horizontal asymptote is $y=4$. Let's plot this above with:
```
fplot(Q(x),[-15,15]);
hold on
fplot(4,[-15,15],'--')
hold off
set(gca, 'XAxisLocation', 'origin', 'YAxisLocation', 'origin')
```
resulting in
![Plot of the function $R(x)$](images/ch05/plot08.png)


Derivatives
------

Since Maple can handle limits and a derivative is a limit, it should come at no surprise that Maple can handle derivatives.  For example, recall that the definition of the derivative of $f(x)=x^{2}$ is
$$ f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(x+h)^{2}-x^{2}}{h} $$


If you enter in the limit
```
syms x h
limit(((x+h)^2-x^2)/h,h,0)
```
you get $2x$. 

Of course, Matlab can do the derivative directly without the use of the limit using the `diff` command:
```
diff(x^2,x)
```
returns $2x$. 

#### Exercises

Find the following derivatives:

* $\displaystyle y=\sin(2x)$
* $x^2 e^{-3x}$
* $\dfrac{\ln(x^2+1)}{\tan(x)}$

### Higher Derivatives

Maple can also do 2nd-order and higher derivatives quite easily.  Here's an example.  Consider the function
```
g(x)=sin(pi*x)
```
then one can find the first three derivatives or  $g'(x), g''(x),g'''(x)$ with 
```
diff(g(x),x)
diff(g(x),x,2)
diff(g(x),x,3)
```

Plots of a function with its tangent line
----

Consider the function $f(x)=x^{2}$.  Above, we saw the details of finding the secant line through this function to approximate the tangent line.  Here, however, we will just plot a function and it's tangent line.

The tangent line to the function at $x=1$ can be written using the point-slope form as
```
tanLine:=f'(1)(x-1)+f(1)
```
and then plotting the two is
```
plot([f(x), tanLine], x = -1 .. 3, title = typeset("A plot of %1 and its tangent line", x^2), legend = [f(x), "tangent line"])
```
resulting in the following plot.

![Plot of the function $x^{2}$ and its tangent line](images/ch04/plot7.png)


Implicit Differentiation
------

If we have a function, then taking the derivative is done by hand using the rules of differentiation and in Maple using one of the techniques above.  However, we don't always have a function to represent a curve.  The classic example is a circle.  Consider the circle with radius 5:
$$x^{2}+y^{2}=25$$
It isn't a function (why not?), so we can't differentiate it like we can with a function.  And we still would like to find out geometric information like a tangent line to the curve at a point.  

This is where implicit differentiation helps us out.  By hand, taking the derivative implicitly on both sides of the equation above, leads to
$$2x+2y\frac{dy}{dx}=0$$
and solving for $dy/dx$ leads to
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{x}{y}$$

To do this in Maple, there's only one important difference.  We need to tell Maple that the variable $y$ is actually a function of $x$, so whereever we see a $y$ in the equation, type $y(x)$.  

$$x^{2}+y(x)^{2}=1$$
and then take the derivative of this using the `diff` ESC version with the line number will result in
$$2x+\left(2y\frac{d}{dx}y(x)\right) = 0$$
and then we can use the `solve` command to find the result for the derivative.
```
solve((##),diff(y(x),x))
```

where \#\# is the line number of the equation above and you can leave `diff(y(x),x)` as is or ESC it to make it look nicer.  Either way, you will get:
$$-\frac{x}{y(x)}$$

Lastly, there is another way to do this.  Look at the `implicitdiff` command that is built-in to Maple.  See if you can find the derivative of $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$ using this command.

Let's say we want to find the tangent line to the curve at the point $(3,4)$.  If we plug the point into the derivative we will get $m=-3/4$ so the line will be $y=-\frac{3}{4} (x-3)+4$.  


### Finding second derivatives implicitly.  

We can also find second and higher derivatives implicitly using `implicitdiff`.  For example, if we have the curve $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$, then the second derivative can be found by
```
implicitdiff(x^2+y^2=25,y,x,x)
```
and the result is:
\\[-\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{y^{3}}\\]


Implicit Plots
-----

Maple can plot curves based on equations in an implicit manner.  The command `implicitplot` is a command in the `plots` package.
```
with(plots):
```
then we'll plot the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$, then
```
implicitplot(x^2+y^2=25,x=-6..6,y=-6..6)
```
will give the following result.

![Plot of a circle of radius 5](images/ch04/plot9.png)

If we also plot the tangent line to the curve using:
```
implicitplot([x^2+y^2=25,y=-3/4(x-3)+4],x=-6..6,y=-6..6,color=[red,blue],legend=[x^2+y^2=25,"tangent line"])
```

![Plot of a circle of radius 5 and its tangent line](images/ch04/plot10.png)

Note: if you are plotting curves with the `implicitplot` command, then all curves need to be as equations.  This is different than plotting with the `plot` command in that all curves must be expressions.
