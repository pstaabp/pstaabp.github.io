Recursive Iteration
=======

Earlier, we have seen a few cases of iteration, in particular recursive iteration.  For example, the sequence:
$$a_{n} = \frac{1}{a_{n-1}+1}$$
with $a_0=1$ generates a sequence.  In [Chapter 10](ch-10.html) we found the first few terms and then found the limit of this.  Recall that if we define:
```
a:=n->1/(1+a(n-1))
a(0):=1
``````

then `seq(a(n),n=1..10)` generates the first 10 terms or
$$1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{5},\frac{5}{8},{\frac {8}{13}},{\frac {13}{21}},{\frac {21}{34}},{\frac {34}{55}},{\frac {55}{89}},{\frac {89}{144}}$$

and as we discovered above, this sequence converges to the golden mean (or golden ratio)
$$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$$


Finding $\sqrt{a}$
------

Another useful iterative sequence is the following:
$$x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2+a}{2x_n}\qquad x_0=a$$

for a positive number $a$.  We will show that this converges to $\sqrt{a}$.  For example, if $a=2$, then 

```
x:=n->(x(n)^2+2)/(2*x(n-1))
x(0):=2
```

(and again make sure that the $x_0$ is entered after the general formula.)  If we find the first few terms of this we get:
$$\frac{3}{2},\frac{17}{12},\frac{577}{408},\frac{665857}{470832},\frac{886731088897}{627013566048},\ldots$$

and then the fraction gets quite large because $x_0$ is an integer and Maple is trying to keep everything as exact numbers (so returns a rational).  If instead, we use $x(0):=2.0$, the rerun the first few terms:
$$2.0,1.500000000,1.416666666,1.414215686,1.414213562,
\ldots$$


###Exercise.  

Use the above to find $\sqrt{5}$.  


Newton's Method
-------

(First, because trying any of these, you'll probably want to `unassign('x')` to get everything to work correctly.)


The above formula is a specific case of Newton's method for finding roots.  Here's a geometric view of Newton's method.  

We intend to find the point $x^{\star}$ such that $f(x)=0$.  We don't know how to find $x^{\star}$, but have an approximate solution, call it $x_0$.  Draw the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at $x_0$.  The following plot is an example with $f(x)=x^2-2$ and $x_0=0.4$:

![Newton's Method for $f(x)=x^2-2$](images/ch12/plot01.png)

The point on the left is $x_0=0.4$ and the blue line is the tangent line there.  Instead of using the function, we use the tangent line, which is easy to solve.  That value is $x_1=2.7$.  At this point (no pun intended), we find the tangent line at $x_1$ and find where it crosses the $x$-axis.  

This process continues indefinitely and (for this example), it converges to $\sqrt{2}$.  

###Why this works

Recall that the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at $x=a$ is
$$y=f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$$
and if we set $y=0$ in the tangent line because we are seeking the root (where the function is 0)
$$0=f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$$
and then we solve for $x$.  (Either by hand or let Maple do it).
$$x=a+\frac{f(a)}{f'(a)}$$

Next, if we let $a=x_0$, our initial point and $x$ be $x_1$, the next point:
$$x_1=x_0+\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$$

or in general:
$$x_{n+1}=x_n+\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$

and this last equation is called *Newton's rootfinding method* (or just *Newton's method*)


###Example

Use Newton's method to find the solution to $\cos x = x$.

If we let $f(x)=x-\cos x$ and perform Newton's method.  Since, $f'(x)=1+\sin x$, this means that 
$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n-\cos x_n}{1+\sin x_n}$$
and let's use $x_0=0$ as an initial guess.  

In Maple, if we enter:
```
x:=n->x(n-1)-(x(n-1)-cos(x(n-1)))/(1+sin(x(n-1)))
x(0):=0.0
```

and then `seq(x(n),n=0..5)` results in 
$$0., 1.000000000, 0.7503638679, 0.7391128909, 0.7390851334, 0.7390851332$$

As you can see from the sequence, the last two numbers are the same for the first 9 digits.  

And looking at a plot of $x$ and $\cos x$, 

![Plot looking for the solution of $x=\cos x$](images/ch12/plot02.png)

The solution looks like about 0.73.  

###Exercise 

There are two $x$ values such that $1-x^2=\sin x$.  Find the solution that satisfies $x\lt 0$.  Plot the two function to see if your answer is reasonable.  


###Using the built-in `NewtonsMethod` command

There is a command called `NewtonsMethod` in the `Student[Calculus1]` package.  Look at the Help Browser for the command and explore the options.  Reproduce the problems above.
