Linear Algebra in a huge field of mathematics and many standard operations in linear algebra is Matlab.  The `Mat` in Matlab is for matrix, so linear algebra is at the heart of Matlab.   

Vectors
-----

There are two standard types of Vectors, column vectors and row vectors and Matlab has both.  If you want to enter the column vector
$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ -2 \\ 3 \end{array} \right]$$

you can type:
```
v=[4;-2;3]
```



If you want a row vector, like
$$ \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 2 & 3 \end{array}\right]$$
you can enter this as
```
v2 = [1,2,3]
```
or `[1 2 3]`.  Recall also, the colon operator. This will generate row vectors.  For example, `v3=1:4` is the row vector 
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \end{array}\right]$$

We can use the transpose operator `'` along with the colon notation to get column vectors:
```
w = (1:3:7)'
```
generates the column vector:
$$\left[\begin{array}{c}
1 \\ 4  \\ 7 \end{array}
\right]$$

We will see the tranpose operator on arrays below, but if you apply it to vectors, it switches between row vectors and column vectors. 

###Dot and Cross Products

You can take the dot product of two column vectors of the same length with the command `dot`.  For example
```
dot(v,w)
```

returns 17.  

and to find the cross product, try
```
cross(v,w)
```

which returns the vector
$$\left[\begin{array}{r} -26 \\ -25 \\ 18 \end{array}\right]$$


Matrices
-----

To enter a matrix in Matlab, it is entered row by row. Consider the matrix:
$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \end{array} \right]$$
you can enter this as
```
A=[1,2,3,4;5,6,7,8;9,10,11,12]
```

Let's also define the matrix $B$ to be a 3 by 4 matrix of all ones, which can be done with
```
B=ones(3,4)
```

and this will look like:
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
  1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right]$$


And a 3 by 3 matrix with the numbers 2, $-1$ and 4 on the diagonal,
```
C=diag([2,-1,4])
```

and this will look like
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 2 & 0 & 0  \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \end{array} \right]$$

###Adding and Subtracting Matrices

We can add the matrices $A$ and $B$ because they are the same size and can using standard notation:
```
A+B
```

which will return:
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}  
2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\  
6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ 
10 & 11 & 12 & 13 
\end{array} \right]$$

and if we subtract
```
A-B
```

Matlab returns
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ 
8 & 9 & 10 & 11  \end{array} \right]$$


If we try to add $A$ and $C$, we get the error:
```
Matrix dimensions must agree.
```

this is because the two matrices are not the same size.  

### Scalar multiplication

Recall that Scalar multiplication of either a vector or a matrix results in a vector a matrix that is the product of the scalar and each element of the vector or matrix.  For example, $3v$ for the vector $v$ above is
$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 8 \\ -4 \\ 3\end{array}\right]$$
and $-2A$ is

$$\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 
-2&-4&-6&-8\\ 
-10&-12&-14&-16\\
-18&-20&-22&-24
\end {array} \right]$$

###Multiplying Matrices

Recall that two multiply 2 matrices, the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix.  For example if we have the matrix
```
P=[3,2,0;1,-2,4;0,2,5]
```

If we multiply $P$ and $A$, using `P*A` to get

$$\left[ 
    \begin{array}{cccc} 
13&18&23&28\\ 
27&30&33& 36\\ 
55&62&69&76
\end{array} 
\right]$$


We can also use the dot notation to multiply matrices and vectors.  For example, `P*v` is

$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 8\\20\\11\end{array}\right]$$

If we don't have compatibly-sized matrices, for example, $A$ and $B$, and try `A*B`, we get:
```
Error using  * 
Incorrect dimensions for matrix multiplication. Check that the number 
of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the 
second matrix. To perform elementwise multiplication, use '.*'.
```

#### Exercise

Let

$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 3 \\ -2 & 4 \\ 5 & 0\end{array}\right]$$
$$B=\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 3 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ -1 &4 & -1 \end{array}\right]$$
$$C=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 &4 \\ -2 & 1 \end{array}\right]$$
$$\vec{v} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 2 \end{array}\right]$$
$$\vec{u} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 5 \\ -2 \end{array}\right]$$


Find the following or state the operation is not compatible.

1. $AB$
2. $AC$
3. $BC$
5. $A\vec{v}$
6. $A\vec{u}$
7. $B\vec{u}$.  

Identity Matrix
--------

A square matrix with all zeros except 1's on the diagonal, is called an *identity matrix*.  The identity matrices of size 2 by 2, 3 by 3 and 4 by 4 are

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&1\end{array}\right]&\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{array}\right]&
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right]\end{array}$$

An identity matrix has the property that if you mulitply a matrix or a vector by the identity matrix, the matrix or vector is returned.  More particularly,
$$\begin{array}{cccc}IA=A & AI=A & I\vec{v}=\vec{v} & \vec{v}I=\vec{v}\end{array}$$

To get an Identity matrix in Matlab, use the `eye` command. For example
```
eye(3)
```

returns a 3 by 3 identity matrix.

#### Exercise

Using the vector $\vec{v}$ and matrix $A$ above, find

1. $I\vec{v}$
2. $\vec{v}I$
3. $IA$
4. $AI$.

and show that you get the vector or matrix back. Make sure that you use the identity matrix of the correct size.  


Matrix Transpose
-------

Recall that the transpose of a matrix is a new matrix where the rows of the tranpose are the columns of the original matrix.  For example,

$$A^{T} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 5 & 9 \\ 
2 & 6 & 10 \\ 
3 & 7 & 11 \\ 
4 & 8 & 12 \end{array}\right]$$

This can be done in Matlab using the `'` command:
```
A'
```

returns the matrix above.  

Gaussian Elimination
--------

One of the first concepts in linear algebra is how to solve linear systems.  For example,
$$\begin{array}{rl} 3x- 2y & = 4 \\
x + 5y & = 7 \end{array}$$

Matlab can solve this by using the `solve` command such as
```
syms x y
[x_ans,y_ans]=solve([3*x-2*y==4,x+5*y==7])
```

which returns $\{x=2,y=1\}$.  In linear algebra, we find the augmented coefficient matrix as
$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 3 & -2 & 4 \\ 1 & 5 & 7 \end{array}\right]$$

One method is to use row operations on the matix to reduce the matrix to a more useful form.  We can put the matrix into Reduced-Row Echelon Form with 
```
rref(A)
```
which returns: 

$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 2\\0 &1 &1\end{array}\right]$$
and this can be written as the two equations $x=2$, $y=1$, same as above.

Another example is 
```
A=[ ...
    5 3 5 1; ...
    5 4 1 1 ; ...
    5 2 2 5]
```
where the ... means to continue the input.  This is used to make it easier to read as a matrix. If we do `rref(A)`, then the result is:

```
    1.0000         0         0    2.1429
         0    1.0000         0   -2.2857
         0         0    1.0000   -0.5714
```
and perhaps we want fractions instead of decimals--to ensure no round off errors.  To use exact arithmetic, we'll make a symbolic version of the matrix with
```
A= sym([ ...
    5 3 5 1; ...
    5 4 1 1 ; ...
    5 2 2 5])
```
and then row-reducing with 
```
rref(A)
```
results in 
$$
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & \frac{15}{7}\\
0 & 1 & 0 & -\frac{16}{7}\\
0 & 0 & 1 & -\frac{4}{7}
\end{array}\right)
$$

This shows the solution, $x=15/7, y=-16/7, z=-4/7$.  

###Exercise

The linear system
$$\begin{array}{rl}-3x+4y-5z & = 8\\
-4x-2y-z & = 0 \\
5x-4y+3z & = -16\end{array}$$
can be written as an Augmented Coefficient Matrix:
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}-3 & 4 & -5 & 8\\
-4&-2&-1&0\\5&-4&3&-16\end{array}\right]$$

Use `rref` to reduce the matrix and then write the solution.

Determinants
-------

The [determinant of a matrix](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-determinant.html) is helpful in many different matrix applications including determining if the matrix is singular and it can be used in solving linear systems using [Cramer's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule).

The determinant is applied only to square matrices and is denoted ${\rm det}(A)$ or $|A|$.  If the matrix is a 2 by 2, then
$$\left|\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right|=ad-bc$$

When finding a determinant, often Laplace's Expansion method or row operations are used to find the value.  For example

$$\left|\begin {array}{ccc} 2&-3&1\\ 3&3&0\\2&3&-3\end {array} \right|=2\left|\begin{array}{cc}3&0\\3&-3\end{array}\right|-(-3)\left|\begin{array}{cc}3&0\\2&-3\end{array}\right|+1\left|\begin{array}{cc}3&3\\2&3\end{array}\right|$$

$$\begin{array}{rl}&=2\left((3)(-3)-(3)(0)\right)+3\left((3)(-3)-2(0)\right)+\left((3)(3)-2(3)\right)\\
&=2(-9)+3(-9)+(9-6)=-42\end{array}$$

And using 
```
det(A)
```

returns $-42$ as well.

Matrix Inverse
---------

If a matrix, $A$ is square and it's determiant is not zero, then there exists a matrix called the *inverse* and denoted with the property $AA^{-1}=I$,

One way to find the matrix inverse of $A$ is write the matrix augmented with the identity matrix and then put it in Reduced Row echelon form.

For example, consider the matrix

$$A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}-3&4&-5\\-4&-2&-1\\5&-4&3\end{array}\right]$$
then we write the augmented matrix where the 3 by 3 identity matrix is append on the right side.  We can to this using the command:
```
aug=cat(2,A,eye(3))
```
where the 2 means to concatenate by colums (dimension 2), the two matrices `A` and `eye(3)`, 3 by 3 identity matrix.  This returns 
$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}-3&4&-5&1&0&0\\-4&-2&-1&0&1&0\\5&-4&3&0&0&1\end{array}\right]$$
We can then use `rref(aug)` to get

$$\left[ \begin {array}{cccccc} 1&0&0&{\frac {5}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&{\frac {7}{
36}}\\ 0&1&0&-{\frac {7}{72}}&-\frac{2}{9}&-{\frac {17}{72}}
\\ 0&0&1&-{\frac {13}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&-{\frac {11}{36}}
\end {array} \right] $$

and the right half of the matrix is the inverse or
$$A^{-1}=\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} {\frac {5}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&{\frac {7}{
36}}\\ -{\frac {7}{72}}&-\frac{2}{9}&-{\frac {17}{72}}
\\ -{\frac {13}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&-{\frac {11}{36}}
\end {array} \right]$$


We can also get the same result from the command `inv`:
```
inv(sym(A))
```

returns the same matrix above.  

#### Exercise

1. Find the inverse of
    $$C=\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} -1&-3&0\\-3&2&-1\\1&-3&0\end {array} \right]$$
    using the augmented matrix with the identity matrix.
2. Find the inverse of $C$ using the command `inv`
3. What happens when you try to find the inverse of $$\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} -1&-3&0\\-3&2&-1\\2&-5&1\end{array}\right]?$$




###Using the Matrix Inverse to solve a linear system.

Above we saw the linear system:

The linear system
$$\begin{array}{rl}-3x+4y-5z & = 8\\
-4x-2y-z & = 0 \\
5x-4y+3z & = -16\end{array}$$

and used the Augumented Matrix to find the solution.  Instead, we can write:
$$\begin{array}{rl}A=\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} -3&4&-5\\-4&-2&-1
\\5&-4&3\end {array} \right]&\vec{b}=\left[\begin{array}{c}8\\0\\-16\end{array}\right]\end{array}$$

and then if we write the vector
$$\vec{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}x\\ y\\ z\end{array}\right],$$ then the linear system can be written as $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$. We can solve this in the following way.
$$A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$$
Multiply the equation by $A^{-1}$
$$\begin{array}{rl}A^{-1}A\vec{x}&=A^{-1}\vec{b}\qquad
\text{since $A^{-1}A=I\qquad\qquad$}&\\
I\vec{x}&=A^{-1}\vec{b}\qquad
\text{since $I\vec{x}=\vec{x}\qquad\qquad$}&\\
\vec{x}&=A^{-1}\vec{b}\end{array}$$

Use this to solve the linear system above.

First, we will find $A^{-1}$ using the `inv` command:
```
Ainv=inv(sym(A))
```

which returns
$$\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} {\frac {5}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&{\frac {7}{
36}}\\ -{\frac {7}{72}}&-\frac{2}{9}&-{\frac {17}{72}}
\\ -{\frac {13}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&-{\frac {11}{36}}
\end {array} \right]$$
as we saw above.  

Lastly, we multiply $A^{-1}$ and $\vec{b}$
```
Ainv*b
```

to get:
$$\left[\begin{array}{c}-2\\3\\2\end{array}\right]$$

so the result is $x=-2,y=3,z=2$, the same as we found above.  

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
--------

Another important topic in Linear Algebra is that of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  Recall that a scalar (number) $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a square matrix $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $\vec{v}$ if this satisfies the equation
$$A\vec{v}=\lambda\vec{v}.$$
Finding $\lambda$ and $\vec{v}$ that satisfy this require two steps:

1. The eigenvalues can be found by solving
    $$|A-\lambda I|=0$$where the vertical lines is the determinant of the matrix.  

2. For each eigenvalue, you seek for a vector $\vec{v}$ such that
    $$(A-I\lambda)\vec{v}=\vec{0}$$

#### Example

Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix
$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}4&-1\\-2&3\end{array}\right]$$

Step 1:  Solve $|A-\lambda I|=0$, the *characteristic equation* of the matrix $A$.

```
syms s
A = [4 -1; -2 3]
c_eqn = det(A-s*eye(2))
```

returns $s^{2}-7s+10=0$.  Matlab doesn't have the ability to use $\lambda$ as a vraiable. 
```
eigs = solve(c_eqn==0)
```
returns $2,5$.  There are two eigenvalues for this.  Note: the maximum number of eigenvalues for an $n$ by $n$ matrix is $n$.  

Step 2: For each of the eigenvalues, solve $(A-\lambda I)\vec{v}=0$.  First, consider $\lambda=2$

```
A-eigs(1)*eye(2)
```
returns
$$
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 & -1\\
-2 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$
The eigenvector is a solution to $(A-\lambda I)\vec{v} = \vec{0}$.  We can find $\vec{v}$ by row-reducing the augmented matrix found by
```
aug = cat(2,A-eigs(1)*eye(2),zeros(2,1))
```
which is the matrix: 
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & -1 & 0\\
-2 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$
and row-reducing this with 
```
rref(aug)
```
returns:
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$
If we use variables $x$ and $y$ with this system, the first row of the matrix becomes:
$$
x -\frac{1}{2}y = 0 
$$
or
$$ x = \frac{1}{2}y$$
and if we select $y=2$, then $x=1$ and then the vector
$$ \vec{v}_1 = 
\left[\begin{array}{c}
1 \\ 2
\end{array}\right]
$$
is the eigenvector.  

The eigenvector associated with $\lambda = 5$ is


return the matrix: $$\left[\begin{array}{cc}-1&-1\\-2&-2\end{array}\right]$$.
To solve this we will append the zero vector on the right or
```
aug2 = cat(2,A-eigs(2)*eye(2),zeros(2,1))
```
which returns $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}-1&-1&0\\-2&-2&0\end{array}\right]$$
and then
```
rref(aug2)
```
which returns $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1&1&0\\0&0&0\end{array}\right]$$

The first row of the equation, means that $x+y=0$.  We seek any nonzero solution to this, if $y=-1$ and $x=1$, then the vector is
$$\vec{v}_2=\left[\begin{array}{c}1\\-1\end{array}\right]$$.


In summary for the matrix
$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}4&-1\\-2&3\end{array}\right]$$

The eigenvalues are 5 and 2 and the associated eigenvectors are
$$\begin{array}{rl}\vec{v}_1=\left[\begin{array}{c}1\\-1\end{array}\right]& \vec{v}_2=\left[\begin{array}{c}1\\2\end{array}\right]\end{array}$$

#### Exercise

Use the steps above to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}6&2\\4&4\end{array}\right]$$


### Finding the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors with a single command

Matlab (along with many related software packages) will find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.  Technically, they are usually approximations because the general eigenvalue problem is hard to do from a computational point of view as the matrices get large.  

Of course, Matlab can just find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors  as well.

Returning to the matrix:$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}4&-1\\ -2&3\end{array}\right]$$ we can let Matlab find the eigenvalues directly with 
```
eig(A)
```

and you get:
$$\left[\begin{array}{c}5\\2\end{array}\right]$$
which are the roots of the characteristic polynomial.  If you enter:
```
[v,s] = eig(A)
```
it returns both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  You'll see:
```
v = 2×2    
    0.7071    0.4472
   -0.7071    0.8944
```
and 
```
s = 2×2    
     5     0
     0     2
```

The columns of the `v` matrix are the eigenvectors.  Recall that any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is an eigenvector.  Matlab scales everything so the length of eigenvectors are 1.  

The matrix `s` has the eigenvalues on the diagonal.  These are returned as matrices because there are some nice features of eigenvalue/vectors in matrix form.
